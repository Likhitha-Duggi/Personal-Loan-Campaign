# Personal-Loan-Campaign

Key Features

## Project 1: Personal Loan Prediction
#### Overview
This project aims to predict whether a liability customer will buy personal loans based on their characteristics. We used various decision tree models to analyze customer attributes and identify key factors influencing loan purchases.

Implemented multiple decision tree models: scikit-learn, pre-pruned, and post-pruned
Achieved high accuracy (96.7%) and recall (93.3%) with the best-performing model
Identified crucial variables: Income, Family, Education, Age, CCAvg, and Experience


## Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction
#### Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a bank, helping to identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.
Key Features

Developed a model with high accuracy for identifying non-exiting customers (Precision: 0.92)
Achieved moderate recall (0.70) for identifying customers likely to exit
Balanced precision and recall for exited customers (F1-Score: 0.59)


### General Approach
Both projects utilize machine learning algorithms to:

Predict customer behavior (loan purchases and churn)
Understand significant customer attributes driving decisions
Identify customer segments for targeted marketing and retention efforts

By leveraging these insights, banks can optimize their marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall business performance.
